sudo apt install python3.12-venv        (need this package to create venv)
python3 -m venv myenv                   (created this venv)


Why to use pipenv over venv?

pipenv: Automatically resolves dependency conflicts when installing packages, ensuring 
that your project has compatible versions of all required libraries.
venv: Does not provide built-in dependency resolution. Developers need to resolve 
conflicts manually.

First of we need to install pipenv.
        pip install pipenv
        pipenv install              (this helps to install dependecies on other device.)


okay so pipenv is created we need to actiavte it using 
        pipenv shell
    Activated


This will install the package and automatically update the Pipfile with the dependency.
    pipenv install requests

If you want to install a specific version of a package:
    pipenv install requests==2.28.1


Now just share the whole the project using  git to other than they can install all the 
dependecies through pipfile.lock
