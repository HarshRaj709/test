sudo apt install python3.12-venv        (need this package to create venv)
python3 -m venv myenv                   (created this venv)


Why to use pipenv over venv?

pipenv: Automatically resolves dependency conflicts when installing packages, ensuring 
that your project has compatible versions of all required libraries.
venv: Does not provide built-in dependency resolution. Developers need to resolve 
conflicts manually.

First of we need to install pipenv.
        sudo pip install pipenv
        pipenv install              (this helps to install dependecies on other device.)


okay so pipenv is created we need to actiavte it using 
        pipenv shell
    Activated


This will install the package and automatically update the Pipfile with the dependency.
    pipenv install requests

If you want to install a specific version of a package:
    pipenv install requests==2.28.1


Now just share the whole the project using  git to other than they can install all the 
dependecies through pipfile.lock

Finnaly pushed with pipenv file ......

exit command is use to exit from pipenv.

                            -------------> pyenv <---------------

its just a version manager, helps to manage multiple versions of python....

Why Use pyenv?
    Install multiple versions of Python (e.g., 3.8, 3.12) and easily switch between them.
    Manage project-specific Python versions with .python-version.
    Avoid relying on the system Python, which might break if you install or remove global 
    packages.

Too many things need to run this successfully.
    sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
    libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev \
    git

Now we can run command to install pyenv 
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash

After that we need to clone the official repo of pyenv....
    git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv

Check its version.
    ~/.pyenv/bin/pyenv --version        -- The ~ symbol in Linux (and Unix-based systems
                                            like Ubuntu) is shorthand for your home 
                                            directory.

                                            cd ~  == cd /home/savera

Install and Manage Python Versions with pyenv
The first real step with pyenv is to use it to manage different Python versions for 
your projects. Here's how to get started:

Install Python Versions
Use pyenv to install different Python versions that you need for your projects. For example:
    pyenv install 3.8.10
    pyenv install 3.9.6

we can also check available versions:
    pyenv install --list

Set python version globally
    pyenv global 3.8.10

set python version Locally
    pyenv locally 3.9.9



------------> Main things

Set Python Versions per Project
If you need different versions of Python for different projects, you can specify a 
local version for a project directory.

Set Local Version
Navigate to the project folder and set a specific Python version for that project:
    cd ~/Desktop/my_project
    pyenv local 3.9.6
This creates a .python-version file in that directory, and whenever youâ€™re in that 
directory, pyenv will automatically switch to the correct Python version (3.9.6 in 
this case).


To check current pyenv python version
    pyenv version



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            --------------> MRO (Method Resolution Order) <---------------

It tells the oops order to find method or attributes

There are mainly 3 Rules in Method Resolution Order.

Rule 1: Python first search in child class and then goes to parent child.

Rule 2: It follows Depth first left to right approach

Rule 3: we can use mro()method for knowing mro of any class objects.

Program in mro.py file.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                ---------> Context Manager in Python <------------  

A Context Manager in Python is a construct that allows you to set up and tear down 
resources automatically. It is typically used (with) the with statement and is ideal 
for tasks such as file handling, database connections, network connections, or locking 
mechanisms, where resources need to be acquired and released cleanly.

There are 2 main things in context Manger ... Enter and exit

    __enter__(): The open() function opens the file and returns the file object (file).
    __exit__(): When the with block exits (either after successful execution or an 
                exception), the __exit__() method automatically closes the file.

    class MyContextManager:
        def __enter__(self):
            print("Entering the context")
            return self  # Optionally return a value to the `as` variable

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
            print("Exiting the context")
            if exc_type:
                print(f"An error occurred: {exc_value}")
            return True  # Suppresses exceptions (if any)

    # Using the custom context manager
    with MyContextManager() as cm:
        print("Inside the context")
        # Uncomment the next line to see exception handling in action
        # raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

Main Use:
Ensures resources like files, network connections, or database connections are 
closed or released, even when an exception occurs.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ------------------> Multi threading And Multi Tasking <----------------


MultiThreading is basically used to run multiple thread simultaneously but because of 
python's GIL it not work concurrently as GIL allows to run 1 thread at a time, limiting 
true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.

Use Case:
    I/O-bound operations (e.g., reading files, network requests, database queries).
    Lightweight tasks that require sharing memory between threads.


Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own Python 
interpreter and memory space. This bypasses the GIL, allowing true parallelism and 
making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks.

Use Case:
    CPU-bound tasks (e.g., mathematical computations, data processing).
    Tasks requiring true parallelism across multiple CPU cores.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                ---------------> Asyncio <--------------------

asyncio is a powerful Python library used for writing asynchronous programs. It 
provides a foundation for building concurrent code using coroutines, event loops, 
tasks, and more. This guide will cover every aspect of asyncio, from basic concepts 
to advanced usage.

    Key Features:
        Efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks.
        Single-threaded cooperative multitasking.
        Non-blocking execution of multiple tasks.

    Simply concurrent programing ke liye use krte h to save time.


Example:
        async def task1():
            print("Task 1 is starting...")
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
            print("Task 1 is done!")

        async def task2():
            print("Task 2 is starting...")
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            print("Task 2 is done!")

        async def main():
            # Schedule both tasks to run concurrently
            await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())         #used to gather all the tasks

        asyncio.run(main())             #then run them concurrently and jiska execution 
                                        time km hoga wo run hokr khatam ho jayega and 
                                        dusra run hota rhega.


MultiThreading, Multitasking and asyncio looks same but they works differently.

------------------->Multiprocessing

Definition: A method of achieving parallelism by using multiple processes, each with 
its own memory space.

How it works: Spawns separate processes, each running independently with its own Python 
interpreter.
Use Case: Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., calculations, data processing) as it can 
utilize multiple cores of a CPU.
Advantages:
Bypasses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), allowing true parallel execution.
Suitable for tasks that require heavy computation.

Disadvantages:
Higher memory usage since each process has its own memory space.
Inter-process communication (IPC) can be complex and slow.



------------------->Multithreading

Definition: A method of achieving concurrency using threads within a single process.

How it works: Threads share the same memory space and are lightweight compared to 
processes.
Use Case: Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O, network requests) where threads 
can wait for resources without blocking others.
Advantages:
Lower memory overhead since threads share the same memory.
Easier to share data between threads.
Disadvantages:
Limited by the GIL in Python, preventing true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.
Potential for thread safety issues (e.g., race conditions).




--------------------------->Asyncio


Definition: A framework for writing asynchronous, non-blocking I/O code using coroutines.

How it works: Runs an event loop to manage coroutines, allowing them to pause and 
resume execution without blocking the loop.
Use Case: Ideal for high-level I/O-bound and network-bound tasks (e.g., web scraping, 
server handling, API calls) requiring high concurrency.
Advantages:
Lightweight and efficient for handling thousands of concurrent connections.
No need to manage threads or processes.
Disadvantages:
Not suitable for CPU-bound tasks (can be combined with multiprocessing).
Steeper learning curve due to async/await syntax.
